# FCL - Fileless Command Lines
Known command-lines of fileless malicious executions. 

## Motivation

While hashing malicious files to identify malicious executions is easy, blocking the execution of fileless malware is more challenging.
This repository's purpose is to collect command lines being used by threat actors, to ease the difficult of identifying them.

## Structure

Each FCL file contains\may contain the following data:
* Malware name
* Executing process(es)
* Malicious command-lines (contain dysfunctional URLs)
* Fully\Partially deobfuscated command-lines
* Regular Expression for detection
* Technical write-ups
* Sandbox report links
* Notes

## Contributions
If you have any malicious related command line (deobfuscated or not), sandbox links, technical write-up, regular expression or any useful suggestion, please share it with me and I will update this repository accordingly.
